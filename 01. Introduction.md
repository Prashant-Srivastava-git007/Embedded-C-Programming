# ⚙️ Introduction to Embedded C
## What is an Embedded System?
An **Embedded System** is a combination of:
- **Microprocessor (MP) or Microcontroller (MC)** - The brain
- **Hardware** - Physical electronic components
- **Software** - Programs that control the hardware
- **Mechanical parts** - Physical components (motors, sensors, etc.)

👉 It performs a **specific task** (not like a general-purpose computer).  
**Examples:** Printer, Mouse, Refrigerator.

**Desktop vs Embedded System:**
- Desktop computers are general-purpose (can do many things)
- Embedded systems are designed for one specific job

## 🧩 What is a Program?
A **program** is a set of instructions that tells a computer or microcontroller what to do.  
It also uses **memory** to store data and instructions.

**What a Program Contains:**
