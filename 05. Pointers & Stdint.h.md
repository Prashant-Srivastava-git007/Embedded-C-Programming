# ⚙️ Pointers & Stdint.h in Embedded C

Pointers and fixed-width data types (`stdint.h`) are two of the most important topics in Embedded C.  
Pointers help access memory directly, and `stdint.h` ensures consistent data sizes across platforms.

## 🧩 What is a Pointer?

A **pointer** is a variable that stores the **memory address** of another variable instead of the value itself.

### 🧠 Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    int *p = &a;   // pointer storing address of a

    printf("Value of a = %d\n", a);
    printf("Address of a = %p\n", &a);
    printf("Pointer p stores address = %p\n", p);
    printf("Value through pointer = %d\n", *p);
    return 0;
}
```
### 🧾 Output :
```
Value of a = 10
Address of a = 0x7ffde1a0
Pointer p stores address = 0x7ffde1a0
Value through pointer = 10
```

## 🔹 Pointer Types

Each pointer type can only hold the address of a variable of the same type.

| Pointer Type      | Example             | Description                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `char *`          | `char *p;`          | Points to character data        |
| `int *`           | `int *p;`           | Points to integer data          |
| `float *`         | `float *p;`         | Points to floating-point data   |
| `double *`        | `double *p;`        | Points to double precision data |
| `long long int *` | `long long int *p;` | Points to long integer data     |

> 🧠 Tip: Mismatched pointer types can cause unexpected results during dereferencing.

## 🔸 Read & Write Operations on Pointers

Pointers let you read and modify values directly using memory addresses.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    char ch = 100;
    char *ptr = &ch; // pointer stores address of ch

    printf("Before write: %d\n", *ptr); // read
    *ptr = 65;                          // write (changes ch)
    printf("After write: %d\n", ch);

    return 0;
}
```

### 🧾 Output:

```
Before write: 100
After write: 65
```

🧠 Explanation: `*ptr` reads or writes data stored at the address pointed to by ptr.

---

## 🔁 Pointer Increment & Decrement

Pointers can move forward or backward through memory based on their data type size.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int arr[3] = {10, 20, 30};
    int *p = arr;

    printf("Value at arr[0]: %d\n", *p);
    p++;   // move to next integer (4 bytes ahead)
    printf("Value at arr[1]: %d\n", *p);
    p--;   // move back to previous
    printf("Value back at arr[0]: %d\n", *p);

    return 0;
}
```

### 🧾 Output :
```
Value at arr[0]: 10
Value at arr[1]: 20
Value back at arr[0]: 10
```

🧠 Note: For `int *`, pointer moves by 4 bytes; for `char *`, moves by 1 byte.

## ⚙️ Why Pointers Are Important in Embedded C

Pointers allow:

* Direct access to hardware registers
* Efficient memory manipulation
* Fast data handling (arrays, buffers)
* Reading/writing sensor data from specific memory locations

---

## 🧾 Stdint.h – Fixed Width Integer Types

The `<stdint.h>` header defines standard fixed-width integer types.

It ensures your data types always have consistent size, regardless of compiler or microcontroller.

Without it, an `int` might be 2 bytes on one MCU and 4 bytes on another — which can cause serious bugs.

### 🔹 Why It’s Important in Embedded Systems :

✅ Ensures portability across microcontrollers
✅ Prevents data overflow and type mismatches
✅ Makes code clear and hardware-independent

## 🔸 Common Aliased Data Types

| Type       | Size (bits) | Range                           | Description             |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `int8_t`   | 8           | -128 to 127                     | Signed 8-bit integer    |
| `uint8_t`  | 8           | 0 to 255                        | Unsigned 8-bit integer  |
| `int16_t`  | 16          | -32,768 to 32,767               | Signed 16-bit integer   |
| `uint16_t` | 16          | 0 to 65,535                     | Unsigned 16-bit integer |
| `int32_t`  | 32          | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 | Signed 32-bit integer   |
| `uint32_t` | 32          | 0 to 4,294,967,295              | Unsigned 32-bit integer |
| `int64_t`  | 64          | Large range                     | Signed 64-bit integer   |
| `uint64_t` | 64          | Large range                     | Unsigned 64-bit integer |

🧠 Tip: The “u” in `uint` means unsigned (only positive values).

### 🧩 Example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdint.h>

int main() {
    uint8_t led_state = 1;
    int16_t sensor_value = -200;
    uint32_t distance = 35000;

    printf("LED: %u, Sensor: %d, Distance: %u\n",
           led_state, sensor_value, distance);
    return 0;
}
```

### 🧾 Output:

```
LED: 1, Sensor: -200, Distance: 35000
```
