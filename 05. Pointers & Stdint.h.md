# ⚙️ Day 8 – Pointers & Stdint.h in Embedded C

Pointers and fixed-width data types (`stdint.h`) are two of the most important topics in Embedded C.  
Pointers help access memory directly, and `stdint.h` ensures consistent data sizes across platforms.

## 🧩 What is a Pointer?

A **pointer** is a variable that stores the **memory address** of another variable instead of the value itself.

### 🧠 Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    int *p = &a;   // pointer storing address of a

    printf("Value of a = %d\n", a);
    printf("Address of a = %p\n", &a);
    printf("Pointer p stores address = %p\n", p);
    printf("Value through pointer = %d\n", *p);
    return 0;
}
```
🧾 Output :
```
Value of a = 10
Address of a = 0x7ffde1a0
Pointer p stores address = 0x7ffde1a0
Value through pointer = 10
```
