## 📘 About the Repository

This project provides well-structured notes and learning materials that explain **embedded systems** and **C programming for microcontrollers** in simple language.  
The notes are based on the Day 1–30 Embedded C Programming Challenge by **Pantech Prolabs**.

Each day covers core embedded concepts, programming logic, and hardware interfacing examples with **STM32 Nucleo-64 (NUCLEO-F411RE)**.
