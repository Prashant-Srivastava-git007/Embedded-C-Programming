# 🌟 Introduction to C Programming 

## 🧩 1. Basic Structure of a C Program

A C program usually follows this structure:

1. **Documentation Section** – Comments to explain what the program does.  
2. **Link Section** – Includes header files using `#include`.  
3. **Definition Section** – Defines constants or macros.  
4. **Global Declaration Section** – Declares global variables or functions.  
5. **`main()` Function** – The program execution starts here.  
6. **Declaration Part** – Declare variables inside `main()`.  
7. **Executable Part** – Write the actual code (logic/statements).  
8. **Subprogram Section** – Other user-defined functions (besides `main`).

### ✅ Example:
```c
// Sample program
#include <stdio.h>

int a = 10; // global variable

int main() {
    int x; // local variable
    printf("Input an integer:\n");
    scanf("%d", &x);
    printf("Value is: %d\n", x);
    return 0;
}
```

## 💬 2. Comments in C

Comments are ignored by the compiler but useful to explain your code.

🟢 Single Line Comment :- `// This is a sample comment`

🟣 Multi-Line Comment :- `/* This is a multi-line comment */`

## 🧠 3. Data Types in C

Data types define what kind of data a variable can store and how much memory it uses.

| Data Type      | Size (Bytes) | Typical Range                   |
| -------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------- |
| signed char    | 1            | -128 to 127                     |
| unsigned char  | 1            | 0 to 255                        |
| short int      | 2            | -32,768 to 32,767               |
| unsigned short | 2            | 0 to 65,535                     |
| int            | 4            | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 |
| unsigned int   | 4            | 0 to 4,294,967,295              |
| long           | 8            | Very large range                |

> 💡 Note: Actual size and range may vary depending on your compiler or system.

## 📦 4. Variables

Variables are names given to memory locations to store data.

```c
int myAge;      // Declaration
myAge = 23;     // Initialization
int myAge = 23; // Both Together 
```

### 📍 Variable Scope

* Local Variable: Accessible only inside the function/block where it’s defined.
* Global Variable: Declared outside all functions and accessible from anywhere in the program.

---

## 🏷️ 5. Keywords in C

Keywords are reserved words in C that have special meanings.
You cannot use them as variable names.

Examples:
`int`, `char`, `return`, `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`

---

## 🧾 6. Rules for Naming Variables

### ✅ Valid Rules:

* Use letters (`a-z`, `A-Z`), digits (`0-9`), and underscores (`_`).
* First character cannot be a digit.
* No spaces or special characters allowed.
* Cannot use C keywords.
* Keep names short and meaningful (prefer under 30 characters).

Examples: 
```c
int myAge;          // ✅ valid
char grade_A;       // ✅ valid
int 123abc;         // ❌ invalid (starts with digit)
int my car number;  // ❌ invalid (contains spaces)
```

## ⚙️ 7. Storage Size and Range Table

| Data Type          | Size (Bytes) | Range                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| signed char        | 1            | -128 to 127                                             |
| unsigned char      | 1            | 0 to 255                                                |
| short int          | 2            | -32,768 to 32,767                                       |
| unsigned short int | 2            | 0 to 65,535                                             |
| int                | 4            | -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647                         |
| unsigned int       | 4            | 0 to 4,294,967,295                                      |
| long               | 8            | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 |
